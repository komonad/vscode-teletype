# vscode-teletype 

Current state:

This plugin can now connect to a [teletype](https://teletype.atom.io/) based co-editing system as a *guest*.

TODOs:

- [x] Add local authentication key storage
- [x] Add local portal id storage
- [ ] Fix wrong guest tether update behaviour
- [ ] **Add Share Portal functionality**
- [ ] Fix wrong peer selection change when sending local text updates
- [ ] Add pending queue to editor binding
- [ ] Fix missing disposable handling (WIP)
- [ ] Fix some network issues (connection speed/robustness)
- [ ] Fix editor switching problems
- [ ] Fix the chaotic vscode.TextEditors management
- [ ] ... (something maybe I will come up later)
